# AI Internship ‚Äì Week 1 Tasks

This repository contains all my work from **Week 1** of the Artificial Intelligence Internship by Velocity Solutions.

## üìå Overview

Week 1 focused on building fundamental understanding of AI and implementing basic intelligent systems using Python. I practiced working with real datasets, rule-based systems, and classic search algorithms.

## ‚úÖ Tasks Completed

### 1. Understanding AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning

- Wrote a short summary comparing AI, ML, and DL.
- Highlighted their differences and real-world applications.
- Included this in a markdown cell inside the Colab notebook.

### 2. Data Exploration and Pandas Practice

- Practiced using the Pandas library in Python for loading and analyzing datasets.
- Explored:
  - **Car Evaluation Dataset**
  - **Tic-Tac-Toe Endgame Dataset**
- Performed `.head()`, `.describe()`, and `.value_counts()` to understand data.
- Applied concepts like feature access, conditional filtering, and basic data cleaning.

### 3. Rule-Based AI Agents

- Built a rule-based recommendation system for car evaluation.
- Applied the rules to every row of the dataset using `apply()` and returned recommendations like:
  - "Highly Recommended"
  - "Acceptable"
  - "Not Recommended"

- Also built a rule-based agent to check if a Tic-Tac-Toe board is a winning state for X.

### 4. Search Algorithms (Maze Solvers)

- Implemented **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** to solve mazes.
- BFS returns the shortest path.
- DFS explores all possible paths and displays every dead end.
- Visualized the path on a 2D grid using `"S"`, `"G"`, `"|"`, `"_"`, and `"#"`.
